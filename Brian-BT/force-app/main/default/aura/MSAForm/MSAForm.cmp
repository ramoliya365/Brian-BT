                                work for {!v.msaSettings.buildertek__Company_Name__c} under various projects subject to these agreed terms and conditions. By using a master

                                (C) If {!v.msaSettings.buildertek__Company_Name__c} requests SUBCONTRACTOR to perform work on a project, {!v.msaSettings.buildertek__Company_Name__c} will authorize the work 
                                by sending SUBCONTRACTOR a work order (“Work Order”), which may be in the form of an e-mail, fax, or 
                                letter confirming the work authorized. A Work Order will be deemed accepted upon SUBCONTRACTOR’s 
                                written execution thereof. If SUBCONTRACTOR elects not to perform the work SUBCONTRACTOR agreesthat, 
                                to allow {!v.msaSettings.buildertek__Company_Name__c} to quickly find another subcontractor, SUBCONTRACTOR will notify {!v.msaSettings.buildertek__Company_Name__c} of SUBCONTRACTOR’s
                                rejection of such Work Order in writing (e-mail is acceptable) within five (5) calendar days after receiving the 
                                Work Order. Failure of SUBCONTRACTOR to provide, within five (5) calendar days, either an executed Work 
                                Order or notice of rejection of such Work Order, may, at the sole discretion of {!v.msaSettings.buildertek__Company_Name__c}, be deemed a rejection 
                                by SUBCONTRACTOR of such Work Order.

                        The following Code of Conduct applies without exception to all subcontractors and specialty trade 
                        subcontractors performing work for {!v.msaSettings.buildertek__Company_Name__c}. By entering into any subcontract or Work Order with {!v.msaSettings.buildertek__Company_Name__c}, you 
                        agree to comply with the following and agree that failing to comply with any provision of this Code of 
                        Conduct is grounds for removal of the offending person(s) from the Project and could be grounds for 
                        terminating your Work Order or Master Subcontract Agreement.

                    <p>
                        1. Personal Protective Equipment is required by {!v.msaSettings.buildertek__Company_Name__c} Superintendent.<br/>
                        2. Proper attire is required always.<br/> 
                        3. Smoking is not permitted on jobsites. Smoking must take place off property.<br/>
                        4. Housekeeping is an organizational priority. A dirty job reflects a lack of professionalism and is generally 
                        unsafe; tradespersons will be responsible for cleaning up for themselves. {!v.msaSettings.buildertek__Company_Name__c} may back charge subcontractors 
                        $50/hr for cleaning up subcontractor debris.<br/>

                        6. Proper safety equipment, safe behavior, and well-maintained equipment are expected of all {!v.msaSettings.buildertek__Company_Name__c} 
                        subcontractors. {!v.msaSettings.buildertek__Company_Name__c} has oversight responsibility of all aspects of the job; therefore, any unsafe behavior, 
                        unsafe equipment, or unsafe conditions attributed to any aspect of the Subcontractor’s work must be 
                        corrected by Subcontractor at its sole expense before work may commence.<br/>
                        7. Proper language and behavior is a must; no foul or loud language, no horseplay of any kind, and no 
                        racial, derogatory, sexually explicit, or otherwise obnoxious behavior or language will be allowed.<br/>
                        8. Respect for the property of the customer, other trade people, and the jobsite in general is required. 
                        Do not use the customer’s or other’s tools without permission and inform the proper person when property 
                        is damaged.<br/><br/> 
                        9. Drugs and alcohol have no place on the jobsite. Any person believed to be under the influence will be 
                        asked to leave the jobsite. This determination is at the discretion of the job superintendent and/or {!v.msaSettings.buildertek__Company_Name__c} 
                        personnel.
